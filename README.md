# COVID-19 Impact on Tourism Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the the effect that Covid-19 has made on tourism trends around the world by applying data science techniques using R.

## Data
The project utilizes two datasets:
- `OECD.xlsx`: tourism data provided by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).
- `World Bank.xlsx`: tourism data provided by the World Bank.

## Analysis
The analysis is conducted using two R scripts:
1. `oecd.R`: Analyzes the data provided by the OECD.
2. `wb.R`: Analyzed the data provided by the World Bank.

## Presentation
The findings of the analysis are presented in the file 'presentation.md' under the directory 'presetation'.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and RStudio if you haven't already.
3. Open the R scripts in RStudio and run them to perform the analysis.
4. Knit the R Markdown presentation file to view the presentation.

# COVID-19 Impact on Tourism Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry using data analysis techniques in R. It aims to understand how various factors such as travel restrictions, lockdown measures, and economic downturns have affected tourism trends.

## Data
The project utilizes two datasets:
- `tourism_data.xlsx`: Contains historical tourism data before and during the pandemic.
- `covid_data.xlsx`: Provides COVID-19 statistics such as infection rates, government responses, etc.

## Analysis
The analysis is conducted using two R scripts:
1. `tourism_analysis.R`: Analyzes the tourism data and identifies trends and patterns.
2. `covid_analysis.R`: Examines the COVID-19 data and its correlation with tourism trends.

## Presentation
The findings of the analysis are presented in an R Markdown presentation:
- `presentation.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the presentation slides.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and RStudio if you haven't already.
3. Open the R scripts in RStudio and run them to perform the analysis.
4. Knit the R Markdown presentation file to HTML to view the presentation.
